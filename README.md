# README

This is the ePortfolio, an assignment for Web Applications I. It uses a Grunt build system in order to compile the SCSS stylesheets. The source HTML files are in the `views` directory, which uses a templating system to insert the headers and footers in each document. The source SCSS files are in the `scss` folder.

The compiled files are available in the `dist` folder.

## Building

Development:

$ grunt watch

Use the following command to deploy the site to an FTP server
