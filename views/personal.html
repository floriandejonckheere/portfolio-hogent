            Hi there! My name is Florian, I am a student at HoGent in Ghent, Belgium. I like Belgian chocolate, Gueuze lambic-beer and long bike rides where I think about life the universe and everything. I have been fascinated by computers since I was little, and I made my first website at the age of 9. I switched to using Linux full-time when I was 13 years old, distrohopping from Ubuntu to Mandrake until I finally found the perfect distribution: <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>.
